Sites like craigslist and Kijjji are available, but do not provide a detailed option for users to select from. So what is a real estate, a real estate can be defined as an umbrella term in that various activities integrated technical construction of real world. Our system provides information to the users about their requirement search through our automation system.

Purpose
We will design the software using the model driven approach as taught in class. This will give us a basic understanding of a Software development process. The main purpose of this website is to provide all property related information which user want they obtain online without wasting their time to contact with real estate broker and ask other people about their requirement. Just post your add or search your specific requirement as per your budget and you get all what you want in few second.

Non Functional Requirements
Usability
As simple and graphically helpful the system is made the more user this system will attract. It is important that the user should be able to add his ads with ease and search and view results according to his search criteria. Keeping in mind the different environment this application will be opened on it should be designed accordingly. 
Performance
When surfing the net people usually are keen on staying on sites that are smooth and responsive. People tend to leave sites that don’t respond timely. So the tasks in the software that are more time consuming than the others should be identified. These tasks should be constrained and tweaked as much possible so they don’t lag the overall response time of the software.
Hardware Limitation & Efficiency
Minimum hardware requirement of 1 GHz processor with 512 MB RAM and good LAN or Wi-Fi for Internet Access is recommended for better search results and performance.
According to the speed of the hardware server, the user and the customer’s request will be fulfilled.
Robustness
The system must be efficient enough to deal with errors that may occur and handle them without any  failure. System should be tolerant to invalid data and unusual operating environments. We put the software to different fault condition that may likely happen in real time environment and make sure that the system behaves accordingly without and crashes.
 Flexibility
The design from the start will be done keeping in mind that if needed we can add additional features to the software.  This is important for future enhancements of the software. 
Regulation Policies
The evaluation of iterative by the customer is one of the policies, which will be following by our project.
INTERFACE TO THE OTHER APPLICATION
There will be more than two application which will be inter connected which are as creating website, maintaining website applications will share a single database.
CRITICALITY OF THE APPLICATION
Unless and until the user of the system is not authorized, the system will not do any processing. The system does processing after user successfully logins to the system.
SAFETY AND SECURITY CONSIDERATION
There is the safety and security in the system as there exist a passcode constraints for all the user so that each user enjoys his own privacy with the authorization and authentication.	
It is important that some data should not also be edited by the system admin. This type of data should not be accessible freely to any. Such as specific information given by seller of his property. This data should be protected from being edited at all. 
HIGHER ORDER LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT
For developing such kind of application here we use java language and Eclipse as in IDE with Tomcat apache for maintaining the data.
