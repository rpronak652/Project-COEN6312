Domain (Online real estate system)

Our selected domain or the topic of interest is Online Real Estate System. We are planning to design a UML model for a real estate system which offers many options to choose from for the customers. The customers would have several options such as the type of property, price, location and size to choose from. As there are many options for the customers, we find this idea fascinating.
